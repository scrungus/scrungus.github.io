		<h1>A Comprehensive Review of the Dracu Riot Save Menu</h1>
		<p>With the official English translation of Dracu Riot due to be released, IÅfm sure plenty of people have found themselves in between the hardest conundrum of their lives, ÅgShould I play Dracu Riot?Åh IÅfm the man with the answers. Sure, IÅfve played less than the first chapter, and although I think IÅfve got a good idea, IÅfm not really sure if I understand whatÅfs happening, or what the story is about. But unlike you, I know what Dracu Riot is, so I guess youÅfre fucked, I have the best info on Dracu Riot that youÅfre going to get, so either you listen to me or you get nothing. Maybe thereÅfs another review of Dracu Riot, but I fail to find any reason a sane person would write a review of a mediocre character based Japanese-only visual novel for an English audience. IÅfm not claiming to be sane, but your options are either me, or someone whoÅfs insane but not self-aware about it.

Anyways, everything I wrote above was just padding, because I have the answer as to if you should play Dracu Riot, and the answer is short and simple, fuck yes you should. Why you ask? Because of its save menu. WhatÅfs so great about the save menu, and why should I care about a save menu you ask? Well, you see, thereÅfs one mystery thatÅfs been keeping me up at night. I havenÅft slept for twelve days, not really. When you have something like this bothering you, youÅfre never really awake, neither are you asleep. ItÅfs a zombie-like state, where all that occupies my mind is this one thought, this one question. My grades have dropped 30% and IÅfm drifting further and further away from everyone who loves me. What is the question which brings me so much grief, so much despair, so much suffering? ItÅfs ÅgWhy didnÅft Dracu Riot receive an Oscar for its save menu?Åh It didnÅft even get a Golden Globe, or a Grammy. What the fuck is this shit? WhoÅfs running these award shows? Soulless corporate sellouts thatÅfs who. Leeches on creative expression, who wouldnÅft recognize a good save menu if it turned into human and hit them over the head with a confusing metaphor, and a brick, and maybe a run-on sentence I donÅft know. Even though I went to church as a kid I had always considered myself an atheist, but then I stopped trying to read the bible, and took a look at the Dracu Riot save menu instead. It turns out that the answers were there all along. The ultimate answer, to life, the universe, and everything, is Dracu RiotÅfs save menu. IÅfm frankly quite livid, that the Louvre has yet to be renovated, to accommodate Dracu Riot, as itÅfs one and only art piece. Because it is art, fine art, if all other art was lost in a nuclear explosion, the world would suffer no real loss.

Anyways, here it is. In all of its glory.
